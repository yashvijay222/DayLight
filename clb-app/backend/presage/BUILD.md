Building & Packaging SmartSpectra C++ SDK on Ubuntu / Linux Mint

This document describes how to build the SmartSpectra SDK from source on Ubuntu 22.04 or Mint 21. Note that on these systems, since installable packages are available, this step is not required if you just want to develop a standalone C++ application using the SDK (see Supported Systems & Architectures for more details on supported platforms and package availability). However, building from source allows you to build the SDK examples, understand how SDK source code works, and even contribute your own desired features to the SDK.

All commands below demonstrate how to build from a terminal (e.g., Ctrl+Alt+T by default on Ubuntu or Activities (Super key) → Terminal). We encourage you to use IDEs, editors, and other GUI tools that wrap around any of the given terminal commands at your discretion.
Prerequisites

Before building from source, ensure you have the following tools available:
Required Tools

    GPG: For verifying package signatures
    curl: For downloading repository keys and package lists
    CMake: Version 3.27.0 or higher for building applications

Note: If you just want to use the SDK (not build from source), see the main README for package installation instructions.
Installing Build Tools

    Install essential build tools (required for CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER):
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y build-essential git lsb-release libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev pkg-config libv4l-dev libgles2-mesa-dev libunwind-dev

    CMake 3.27.0 or newer is required. Ubuntu 22.04 comes with an older version:

    Option A: Install from Kitware Repository (Recommended)
    # Remove old cmake if installed
    sudo apt remove --purge --auto-remove cmake
     
    # Install dependencies
    sudo apt install -y software-properties-common lsb-release wget gnupg
     
    # Download and install Kitware's signing key
    wget -O - https://apt.kitware.com/keys/kitware-archive-latest.asc 2>/dev/null | gpg --dearmor - | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/kitware.gpg >/dev/null
     
    # Add Kitware repository
    echo "deb https://apt.kitware.com/ubuntu/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kitware.list >/dev/null
    sudo apt update
     
    # Install CMake
    sudo apt install cmake

    Option B: Direct Download from GitHub
    # Download and install CMake 3.27.0 directly
    curl -L -o cmake-3.27.0-linux-x86_64.sh https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.27.0/cmake-3.27.0-linux-x86_64.sh
    chmod +x cmake-3.27.0-linux-x86_64.sh
    sudo ./cmake-3.27.0-linux-x86_64.sh --skip-license --prefix=/usr/local

    Install Ninja (recommended) or verify Make is available:
    # Install Ninja for faster builds
    sudo apt install ninja-build
     
    # Verify tools are installed
    cmake --version  # Should be 3.27.0+
    gcc --version    # Should show GCC compiler
    ninja --version  # Should show Ninja version

Setting Up Build Dependencies

Install or build the Physiology Edge library.

Side Note: the Physiology Edge library, packaged as libphysiologyedge-dev, is the C++ backend that all SmartSpectra SDKs rely on to provide a uniform experience across all languages and platforms. This is where some of the computation and communication with Physiology Core API on the cloud takes place. Meanwhile, the SmartSpectra C++ SDK, packages as libsmartspectra-dev, is the C++ open-source library that wraps around the Physiology Edge library to provide a convenient, simple API for C++ developers.

    Ubuntu 22.04 / Mint 21: you can install via Debian package from the Presage Debian Repository. Note: be sure to follow the below directions to only grab what's needed for the build, so that the SDK itself does not get installed from the repository.

    Update the apt database:
    sudo apt update

    Install (or upgrade) the Physiology Edge library:
    sudo apt install libphysiologyedge-dev

    Other linux systems: (partners-only) contact support (<support@presagetech.com>) to obtain a source package and build instructions.

Building for the Host System

    Clone this repository.
    git clone https://github.com/Presage-Security/SmartSpectra/

    Navigate to the C++ SDK root within the cloned repository, e.g.:
    cd SmartSpectra/cpp
    Build the SDK with examples using either Ninja or Make.

        Using Ninja:
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SAMPLES=ON ..
        ninja

        Using Make (on macOS, substitute $(sysctl -n hw.ncpu) for $(nproc) below):

        shell
                mkdir build
                cd build
                cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SAMPLES=ON ..
                make -j$(nproc)
                

CMake Options

Adjust CMake build flags in the above cmake calls as needed.

    If you don't want to build the examples, change -DBUILD_SAMPLES=ON to -DBUILD_SAMPLES=OFF.
    For a debug build, change -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release to -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug.
    The CMake GUI application (sudo apt install cmake-gui) is the graphical counterpart of the command-line cmake tool that will display all available CMake options when provided the source (e.g., SmartSpectra/cpp) and build (e.g., SmartSpectra/cpp/build) directories.

Cross-compiling for Linux Arm64

You can cross-compile the SDK and examples for the Linux arm64 architecture when building on an amd64 Linux machine.

    Install the required cross-compilation tools:
    sudo apt install crossbuild-essential-arm64 gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi binutils-arm-linux-gnueabi

    Specify the provided toolchain file to CMake. E.g., from within SmartSpectra/cpp (assuming SmartSpectra is the root of the repository), run :
    mkdir build-arm64
    cd build-arm64
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SAMPLES=ON -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../toolchains/linux_arm64_toolchain.cmake ..
    make -j$(nproc)

Packaging

Use cpack to generate the desired package in the build folder. E.g., from within SmartSpectra/cpp (assuming SmartSpectra is the root of the repository), run:
cd build
cpack -G DEB

For the above example, if there are no errors in the output, you should see a *.deb package file appear in the build directory.
